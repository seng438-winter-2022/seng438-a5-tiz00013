# Introduction
The goal of this lab was to analyze the integration test data using the reliability assessments tools. The assessment of the failure data was done by Reliability growth Testing using C-SFRAT and Reliability assessment using a Reliability demonstration chart. After analyzing failure data from both techniques, the results computed from the techniques were compared. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques were discussed, and also similarities and differences between them.

## A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of reliability growth analysis 
There are a lot of benefits of the Reliability Growth Analysis and some of them are as follows

1. It helps to enhance the reliability of the system and thus also helps the system to reach the reliability goal.
2. This technique provides a way to deliver the product faster to the software market.
3. Using this technique, product development costs can be reduced since, with this technique, project planning is implemented.

There are some disadvantages of the reliability growth analysis and some of them are mentioned below

1. In order to accurately implement this technique, it requires a lot of resources.
2. This technique is time-consuming.
